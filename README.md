If you want to know more about a specific algorithm or want to have a cleaner, more general implementation, please also visit the wiki.

# Notes

Because Swift is a pretty rapidly evolving programming language, some implementations might not be correct anymore. They were written with Swift 2 and will constantly be updated, but depending on the changes, it could take some time.
